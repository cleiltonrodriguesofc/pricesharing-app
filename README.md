## 1. Introduction

[Provide a brief overview of the project. What does it do? What problem does it solve?]

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js and npm/yarn:** You can download these from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Yarn is often preferred in the React Native/Expo ecosystem.
*   **Expo CLI:** Install it globally using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    # or
    yarn global add expo-cli
    ```
*   **Android Development Environment:** For testing on Android, you need to set up an Android development environment. This typically involves installing Android Studio, which includes the Android SDK, platform tools, and an emulator.
*   **iOS Development Environment:** For testing on iOS, you need a Mac and Xcode installed. Xcode includes the iOS simulator.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

Follow the official React Native or Expo documentation for setting up your development environment if you encounter issues:
*   [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
*   [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/environment-setup/)

## 3. Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```
(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository and `<project_directory>` with the name of the project folder).

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase. You need to set up your own Firebase project and configure the application to use it.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  Add a new Web app to your Firebase project.
3.  Copy your Firebase configuration object.
4.  Update the `firebaseConfig.js` file in the project root with your copied configuration.

```javascript
// firebaseConfig.js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
// import { getAnalytics } from 'firebase/analytics'; // Uncomment if using Analytics
// import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth'; // Uncomment if using Authentication
// import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore'; // Uncomment if using Firestore
// import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage'; // Uncomment if using Storage

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // Optional
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
// const analytics = getAnalytics(app); // Uncomment if using Analytics
// const auth = getAuth(app); // Uncomment if using Authentication
// const db = getFirestore(app); // Uncomment if using Firestore
// const storage = getStorage(app); // Uncomment if using Storage

// export { app, analytics, auth, db, storage }; // Export what you need
export { app }; // Default export if only initializing
```

[Uncomment and export other Firebase services like Auth, Firestore, Storage, etc., based on what your project uses.]

## 4. Project Structure

The project follows a common structure for Expo/React Native applications:

```
.
├── app/                  # Application entry points and navigation
│   ├── (tabs)/           # Tab-based navigation
│   ├── +not-found.tsx    # Not found screen
│   └── _layout.tsx       # Root layout
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/               # UI specific components
│   └── ...
├── screens/              # Individual screens/pages of the application
│   └── ...
├── tests/                # Project tests (using Jest)
│   ├── components/
│   ├── screens/
│   └── setup.js          # Test setup file
├── .idx/                 # IDE related files (e.g., dev environment config)
├── .vscode/              # VS Code configuration
├── App.js                # Main application file
├── babel.config.js       # Babel configuration
├── firebaseConfig.js     # Firebase configuration
├── jest.config.js        # Jest configuration
├── package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts
├── package-lock.json     # Dependency lock file
└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
```

*   **`app/`**: This directory is typically used by Expo Router for file-based navigation. `_layout.tsx` defines the root layout and navigation structure. `(tabs)/` likely contains the screens accessible via the main tab navigation.
*   **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components used across different screens. `ui/` might contain basic UI elements.
*   **`screens/`**: Contains the main screen components of the application, each representing a distinct page or view.
*   **`tests/`**: Houses all project tests, organized by the type of code they test (components, screens).
*   **`.idx/` and `.vscode/`**: Configuration files for development environments.
*   **`App.js`**: The main entry point of the application (though often delegated to `app/_layout.tsx` in newer Expo projects).
*   **`firebaseConfig.js`**: Configuration for connecting to Firebase.
*   **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and defines scripts for running the application and tests.

## 5. Technologies Used

*   **React Native:** A framework for building native mobile apps using React.
*   **Expo:** A framework and platform for universal React applications, providing tools and services for building, deploying, and iterating on native apps.
*   **Jest:** A delightful JavaScript testing framework.
*   **Firebase:** A platform for building web and mobile applications, used here likely for backend services (authentication, database, storage, etc., depending on implementation).
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. (Indicated by `.ts` and `.tsx` files).
*   **Yarn or npm:** Package managers.

## 6. Running Locally

### On Android

1.  Ensure you have an Android emulator running or a physical Android device connected and set up for debugging.
2.  Start the Expo development server:
    ```bash
    expo start --android
    # or
    yarn start --android
    ```
    This will start the server and attempt to open the app on your connected Android device/emulator.
3.  Alternatively, you can use the Expo Go app on your Android device. Download it from the Google Play Store. Once installed, open the app and scan the QR code displayed in your terminal.

### On iOS

1.  Ensure you have the iOS simulator running or a physical iOS device connected and set up for debugging. (Requires a Mac and Xcode).
2.  Start the Expo development server:
    ```bash
    expo start --ios
    # or
    yarn start --ios
    ```
    This will start the server and attempt to open the app on your connected iOS device/simulator.
3.  Alternatively, you can use the Expo Go app on your iOS device. Download it from the App Store. Once installed, open the app and scan the QR code displayed in your terminal.

### On Web

1.  Start the Expo development server:
    ```bash
    expo start --web
    # or
    yarn start --web
    ```
    This will start the server and open the application in your web browser.
